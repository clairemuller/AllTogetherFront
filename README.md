# [AllTogether](https://all-together-app.herokuapp.com/)

AllTogether is a home inventory app to help users keep track of and find belongings in their home. I myself was using a Google sheet to inventory my home and I realized that I now have the skills to turn it into a website!

A user can add rooms, locations inside each room (box #1, closet, etc), and finally items in those locations. Everything can easily and immediately be created, read, updated or deleted. The items table can also be sorted alphabetically by clicking on any header (thanks to [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp)).

I also implemented Google OAuth using an npm package, [React Google Login](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-login). After completion, I refactored the styling to use Sass.
